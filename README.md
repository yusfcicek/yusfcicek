## 🌟 Featured Projects

### **OpenHands Review Agent (AI Code Review Agent)**
An intelligent CI/CD integrated agent that understands the semantic impact of code changes beyond simple diffs.
* **Smart Triage:** Classifies changes (SKIP, AUTO_APPROVE, CRITICAL) to optimize review costs and focus.
* **Semantic Analysis:** Detects ripple effects in code logic that standard linters miss.
* **Policy Enforcement:** Automatically applies custom review policies and SAST security gates using LLM-based reasoning.

### **CVAT Remote Inference Server**
An enterprise-level integration platform that automates the deployment of AI models for production labeling environments.
* **Automation:** Auto-detects new model implementations and generates Nuclio deployment files for zero-config scaling.
* **Efficiency:** Implements **Lazy Initialization** and **Smart Resource Management**, unloading idle models to optimize GPU memory.
* **Orchestration:** Manages multiple model types (Detectors, Trackers, Interactors) through a unified FastAPI interface.

### **High-Performance Multimedia API**
* Designed and developed a reusable, scalable multimedia API in $C++$ using the FFmpeg API.
* Leveraged the **Producer-Consumer Design Pattern** to achieve **sub-10ms real-time video streaming latency**.
* Currently powering 4+ production projects.
